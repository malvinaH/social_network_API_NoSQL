# Social Network API (NoSQL)

  ## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. In this project, I built a social network web application API where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js for routing, and Mongoose packages were used for the fnctionality of the app.
